Anathema takes place in the kingdom of Saint Charles, which suffers under the command of an unjust and authoritarian regime. There, the powerful take advantage of the faith of their people and cause them great suffering.

You are Ivan, a young orphan who blames yourself for your pitiful past while is seen as a problem by the citizens. This inert situation only changed when another young girl, named Amy, went to live in your orphanage. She was a nice girl who helped you overcome your past and create hope for the future. However, one day, angels - the kingdom's security forces - invaded your orphanage and kidnapped Amy without justification. After this, you go to Heaven's Beacon, the central government tower, to seek answers and to rescue your friend.
