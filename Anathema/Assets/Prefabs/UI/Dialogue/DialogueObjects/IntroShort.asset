      text: 'Saint Charles is considered by many a paradise, with it''s beautiful,
        tall, gothic but modern architecture, high security and religious government.
        Here we meet a peculiar kid: Ivan.'
    - title: 
      text: "When Ivan was a child, his parents were sacrificed as a punishment to
        atone for a grave sin he committed, even though he was naive and couldn\u2019t
        know better. As an orphan child, he was disregarded by others as they saw
        him as sinful, tainted. On top of that, parents wouldn\u2019t let their children
        play with him, thinking he would somehow \u201Ccorrupt\u201D them. "
    - title: 
      text: "That made him a very lonely child and, paired with the fact that he blamed
        himself for what happened to his parents, made him miserable.\r"
    - title: 
      text: hat changed when Amy came into the orphanage. She would play with him,
        even though the caretakers would talk against it. Soon enough, they were best
        friends and splitting them up was nearly impossible, they would do any and
        every thing together.
    - title: 
      text: "Amy felt strongly against kingdom of Saint Charles and when confronted
        by Ivan\u2019s life story, she preached to him that it wasn\u2019t his fault,
        but the system\u2019s.\r Ivan was at first reluctant to accept Amy\u2019s
        words, but eventually he opened his eyes and realized that maybe Saint Charles
        wasn\u2019t a paradise after all."
    - title: 
      text: "They made a pact to stay together and help one another survive that hellish
        of a paradise they were in. Or so they thought\u2026\r"
    - title: 
      text: "A month after his 17th birthday, angel guards, regarded as the highest
        nobility in Saint Charles, broke into the orphanage in the middle of the night
        and took Amy by force, without giving any light to what she\u2019d done wrong.
        When prompted by Ivan, rushing in and trying to grab her, he was simply struck
        by the guard of a sword in response."
    - title: 
      text: "\u201CThis isn\u2019t your business. Go back to hell, where you belong.
        Perhaps your parents will be there to welcome you.\u201D - Said the guard."
    - title: 
      text: "Willing to do whatever it took to save Amy, Ivan sneaked out of the orphanage
        and followed the angels to the main tower of Saint Charles, Heaven's Beacon,
        where he will do anything to save his one and only companion, Amy.\r"
