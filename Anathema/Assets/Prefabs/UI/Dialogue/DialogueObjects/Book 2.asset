    - title: 
      text: XXXX/XX/XX Murdered... MURDERED!! There is no oher way of putting it...
        my dear son... my dear prince! Murdered by a filthy peasant!
    - title: 
      text: I won't have it. That kid will be held accontable. That peasant shouldn't
        even have been allowed to be at a 30 meter distance from my dear Enzo. I'm
        sure he did it on purpose! It was all jealously, I tell you!
    - title: 
      text: Judas keeps trying to tell me that it must've been an accident... and
        here I was thinking he was wise! Ha! He doesn't understand how peasants can
        be dangerous!  That demon child pushed my son down those stairs! I'm sure
        of it!
    - title: 
      text: Gabriel agrees with me. He knows better than anyone else how problematic
        the peasantry can be. I've just sent him to town to find and bring me that
        child. This won't be left unsettled.
    - title: 
      text: 'XXXX/XX/XX: Gabriel is back, but not with the child...he has his parents
        instead. It seems that they begged to suffer the consequences in his place.'
    - title: 
      text: According to Gabriel, that would be the best move... the child will be
        treated like the imp he is but we will be seen as mercyful by sparing him!
        We can instead hang his parents... HA! The kid will be blamed for everything
        and will suffer the guilt for the rest of his life!
    - title: 
      text: That's even better than hanging him hahaha! Gabriel is a genius! And who
        knows... their parents could've been the ones who asked him to murder my Enzo!
        That's it! Why else would they offer themselves like that? Guilt of course!
        Disgusting!
    - title: 
      text: 'I''m not wasting time. I''m setting up the trial right away.

        As for that cursed little brat...  I hope to never see him again! I''ll leave
        it to Gabriel to deal with him. I hope he suffers...'
