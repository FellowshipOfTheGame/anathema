    - title: ?????
      text: HAHAHAHA! And what do you plan to do about it?
    - title: ?????
      text: You don't even understand what is going on here, dumb kid. This witch
        here whispered lies to you...
    - title: Ivan
      text: Lies?! The only lies she told me were the ones people like you told me
        several years ago.
    - title: ?????
      text: HAHAHA! What lies?! That you murdered the king's son at age 5!? That you
        are responsible for your parents' death!? That you are cursed from birth!?

    - title: Ivan
      text: The king's son...I... what?
    - title: Amy
      text: Don't listen to Gabriel! He's a manipulative, filthy and treacherous little
        piece of shit!
    - title: Gabriel
      text: HA! Bark all you want, witch. You're not in a position to be able to get
        on my nerves.
    - title: Amy
      text: He's trying to make you feel guilty again... it's all part of his plan!
        Run, Ivan! Go find help!
    - title: ?????
      text: HAHAHA! And who's going to believe in the demon child himself, miss?
    - title: Amy
      text: You're the lowest of the low, a coward excuse of a man, Gabriel.
    - title: Gabriel
      text: Barf! Woof! HAHAHAHAHA!
    - title: Gabriel
      text: Why don't you go back to hiding? Demon child, cursed one, little devil,
        imp... which one do you prefer? Or, may I add... prince murderer?
    - title: Ivan
      text: I-I don't know what you're talking about!
    - title: Amy
      text: Don't listen to him! He's a liar! He killed my parents!
    - title: Amy
      text: All they wanted to do was help people! But then he came with his guards
        and murdered them!

    - title: Amy
      text: Ivan, it's okay. I knew this would happen, sooner or later...
    - title: Amy
      text: It's not your fault. Don't let them trick you otherwise.
    - title: Ivan
      text: Amy...! No! I can't do without you!
