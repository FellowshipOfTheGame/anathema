      text: "When Ivan was a child, his parents were sacrificed as a punishment to
        atone for a grave sin he committed, even though he was naive and couldn\u2019t
        know better. As an orphan child, he was disregarded by others as they saw
        him as sinful, tainted. On top of that, parents wouldn\u2019t let their children
        play with him, thinking he would somehow \u201Ccorrupt\u201D them. "
    - title: 
      text: "Not even the other kids in the orphanage were allowed to play with him
        since the caretakers, knowing that he was the one to commit the sin that got
        his parents killed, prohibited them from interacting with Ivan at all. That
        made him a very lonely child and, paired with the fact that he blamed himself
        for what happened to his parents, made him miserable.\r"

      text: "hat changed when Amy came into the orphanage. Nobody knew why she was
        there, her parents\u2019 death was shrouded in mystery, not even Amy herself
        would talk about it. Amy turned Ivan\u2019s life upside down. She would play
        with him, even though the caretakers would talk against it."
    - title: 
      text: "Even Ivan would try to push her away himself, thinking she would get
        in trouble by talking to him, but she couldn\u2019t care less. Soon enough,
        they were best friends and splitting them up was nearly impossible, they would
        do any and every thing together."
    - title: 
      text: "Amy didn\u2019t care if being with Ivan made others look down on her
        the same way they looked down on him. She felt strongly against kingdom of
        Saint Charles and when confronted by Ivan\u2019s life story, she preached
        to him that it wasn\u2019t his fault, but the system\u2019s.\r"

      text: "Ivan was at first reluctant to accept Amy\u2019s words, as it went against
        everything he knew, but seeing how she would be mistreated by others just
        because she would talk to him even though she was the nicest person he knew
        soon made him open his eyes and realize that maybe it wasn\u2019t a paradise
        after all."
    - title: 
      text: "After that, the wrongdoings of Saint Charles became clear to both of
        them, and they made a pact to stay together and help one another survive that
        hellish of a paradise they were in. Or so they thought\u2026\r"

      text: "A month after his 17th birthday, angel guards, regarded as the highest
        nobility in Saint Charles, broke into the orphanage in the middle of the night
        and took Amy by force, without giving any light to what she\u2019d done wrong.
        When prompted by Ivan, rushing in and trying to grab her, he was simply struck
        by the guard of a sword in response."
    - title: 
      text: "\u201CThis isn\u2019t your business. Go back to hell, where you belong.
        Perhaps your parents will be there to welcome you.\u201D - Said the guard."
    - title: 
      text: "Willing to do whatever it took to save Amy, Ivan sneaked out of the orphanage
        and followed the angels to the main tower of Saint Charles, Heaven's Beacon,
        where he will do anything to save his one and only companion, Amy.\r\n"
