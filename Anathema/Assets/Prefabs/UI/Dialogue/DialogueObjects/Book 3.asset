      text: 'XXXX/XX/XX:  Problematic parents... problematic daughter. We should''ve
        dealt with her alongside her rebel parents. We were careless and didn''t notice
        she was hiding under the bed back when we paid her parents a visit... those

        staff that Amy has been approaching the demon child, Ivan, and his behaviour
        has changed... he''s acting rebellious! That filthy witch must have whispered
        something to him...'

        a lesson, too...'
