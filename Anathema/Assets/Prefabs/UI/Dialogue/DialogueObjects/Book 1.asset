      text: '"Issue Logs: Illegal Sheltering"'
    - title: 
      text: 'XXXX/XX/XX: We''ve been informed by one of our agents that a certain
        couple of medics have been treating and sheltering enemies of the state.'
    - title: 
      text: The name of the suspects are Bernael and Lilith Solas, they also have
        an 11 year old daughter named Amy that lives in the same residence.
    - title: 
      text: As for the people there are sheltering in their basement, they range from
        excommunicates of all sorts to prison fugitives and fallen angels. This is
        a serious sin and needs immediate counteraction.
    - title: 
      text: 'XXXX/XX/XX: I''ve talked to my generals and to king David and we concluded
        that the best course of action is to retaliate directly, but stealthily. '
    - title: 
      text: The sheltered subjects are high profile criminals, several of them were
        originally concealed from the public to avoid... commotions. We came to the
        conclusion that the best course of action is to eliminate them.
    - title: 
      text: As for the couple... we'll have to make something up. The general public
        won't miss the criminals they didn't even know existed but that doesn't apply
        to the couple. We also have the matter of getting rid of all the bodies...
    - title: 
      text: So I came up with the idea of burning the place down. We kill everyone
        first, just to make sure, then we start a fire to get rid of the evidence
        and make it seem like it was the fire that took their lives... Perfect!
    - title: 
      text: I'll begin the preparations immediately. I'll summon trustworty guards
        and we'll do this tonight. If there are no other reports on this log, it means
        the mission was successful.
